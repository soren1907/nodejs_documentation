            <br>
            <p>Our most used method so far has been the “get” method:</p>
            <p>Get methods are used by clients to request a server for some resource. “req” is data send from the client and “res” will be the resource that the server sends to the client.</p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/cs1.jpg" width="500" height="63">
            <p>The get method takes two arguments. Det first one being the endpoint (what we have to type in the url to get to that endpoint) and the second a callback function, which will be used to send response to the client requesting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To use the “get” method, the express module has to be required and attached to a variable. </p>
            <p>Another variable, typically called “app”, calls the express-function and puts an express application inside the variable. (creates object of express module)</p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/cs2.jpg" width="500" height="59">
            <p>app.use makes body/json parser available. Now the methods in app.js can use the json code inside the recieved request bodies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>the “listen”-method is what starts the server. (therefor, listen can be a confusing name).</p>
            <p>It is good coding standard to have this message as the last in the file. </p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/cs3.jpg" width="500" height="162">
            <p>If you declare a port in the start command it will use that port, otherwise due to the “||”, 8081 will be used as the port.</p>
            <p>If you do not include “|| 8081” and try to start to server without writing a port number before "node app.js”, the port would be undefined and the server will not start.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Package.json file can be used for declaring which dependencies should be installed. </p>
            <p>This example shows the code needed for installing express.</p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/cs4.jpg" width="500" height="102">
            <p>Here “dependencies” is the Key and the value is an object that will contain the dependencies.</p>
            <p>Inside the object is a key “express” is declared and the value “4.17.1 ” is the version. </p>
