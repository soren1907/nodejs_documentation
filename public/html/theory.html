            <b>HTTP methods</b>
            <p>We have worked with 4 types of HTTP methods so far. In the code it is a good codingstandard to have the method sorted by types. E.g. all GET-methods first.</p>
            <p>GET:</p>
            <p>Requests server for a resource, Retrieves resources.</p>
            <p>POST:</p>
            <p>Creates new resources with some exceptions</p>
            <p>PUT/PATCH:</p>
            <p>Updates a resource. (PUT: the whole reosurce. PATCH: part of the resource)</p>
            <p>Patch is often best to use. It is used when you don’t want to update the entire resource.</p>
            <p>And you often don’t want to update the id…</p>
            <p>DELETE:</p>
            <p>Deletes/removes a resource</p>
            <br>
            <b>Variables and scope</b>
            <p>Const: immutable</p>
            <p>Let: can change</p>
            <p>Var: global (recommended not to be used in node.js)</p>
            <p>Back in the days it was the only variable. Javascript only has “function scope” and no “block scope”. </p>
            <p>This means that all variables inside a function will be on same level. A variable inside a forloop can be used outside because there is no block scope.</p>
            <p>This theory is only true when variables of type “var” are used and it is why we should avoid using “var”.</p>
            <p>In ES6 the “const” and “let” variables were introduced and they both works  with block scope. As an example look at the code:</p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/scope1.jpg" width="157" height="65">
            <p>This will give an error. Numbers are not available outside the block.</p>
            <img style='border:2px solid #000000' src="../pictures/scope2.jpg" width="157" height="65">
            <p>This will print “123” because var is used, the parent block has access to it.</p>
